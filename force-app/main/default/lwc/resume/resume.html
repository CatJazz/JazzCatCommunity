                  Prior to joining UHW I spent 16 years working for Sierra Club as a Programmer/Analyst in their IT department (with 12 months on their Drupal team).   We had a reasonably complex relational database, running Sybase ASE 15.  
                I gained extensive experience designing and creating reports, writing SQL, creating views and stored procedures, using cursors and manipulating data with TSQL in all manner of ways.  
                I have a good understanding of how to read query execution plans and adjust the joins or add an additional index, if needed, to improve performance.

                <div class="sc-text">
                  I wrote many programs here that allowed staff to interact with an active database of 5.5 million members/supporters.  These included highly detailed and customized reports, individual and bulk updates, exports to Excel/Access or to other low-level file formats and imports of data from 3rd parties.  I designed and wrote many suites of financial reports based on our 18 million transactions in our payment table, allowing for sophisticated analysis of their campaigns.   I wrote programs and reports that allowed for breakdowns of donations at various levels of segmentation and have learned a lot about how direct marketing and response rate analysis work at the data level.  
                I have a firm grasp of accounting principles and also wrote data extracts for upload to the FEC during election cycles for political donations and various IRS reports relating to non-profit giving.

                  I’m very familiar with prospect cultivation and donor management issues and best practices to follow to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
                  I gained a lot of experience dealing with poor quality data.  Sierra Club had an outside vendor responsible for order processing and fulfillment and another for online transactions.  These would supply us with csv files twice a week to be processed and applied to our Sybase db.  For various reasons, the two databases often created duplicated records that needed to be eliminated in Sybase.  I’ve written various de-duping programs to find and fix errors, perform address standardizations and strived to provide automated solutions wherever possible.
