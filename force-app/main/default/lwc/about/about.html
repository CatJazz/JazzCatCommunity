          <li><p>All pages except Shopping Cart are exposed as public pages in Community Builder.</p></li>
          <li><p>The background is added by editing the theme header css, where I also disable default scrolling.</p></li>
          <li><p>My custom nav bar controls the navigation between each community page.</p></li>
          <li><p>Salesforce Cloud:  This is SVG!  I found this on <a href="https://codepen.io/shytiger/pen/gNmexL">Codepen</a> and fell in love with the technique.</p></li>
          <li><p>Alas, there is <a href="https://github.com/salesforce/lwc/issues/2063">a bug in LWC</a> at the moment which stops this working.  Their suggested workaround did not produce the desired result, so this is in a Visual Force page, rather than a Lightning Web Component.</p></li>

            <li><p>The Shopping Cart is a fully functional implementation of an imaginary cat poster store.</p></li>
            <li><p>This requires a sign up, as Salesforce prohibts a Lightning Community guest from seeing platform content.</p></li>
            <li><p>The sign up page is also uses the same background technique as the home page</p></li>
            <li><p>I initially used <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.use_message_channel">Lightning Message Service</a> to broadcast changes to input fields which the other components listen to.</p></li>          
            <li><p>However, Salesforce don't allow LMS in communities at the moment (<a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.use_message_channel_considerations">SF doc</a>), so you will notice this has been commented out in the code and replaced with <a href="https://github.com/developerforce/pubsub">pubsub</a></p></li>
